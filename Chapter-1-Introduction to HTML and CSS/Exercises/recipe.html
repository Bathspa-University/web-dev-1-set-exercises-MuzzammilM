    <ol>  <!---This ol tag is used to create an ordered list which displays steps on how to make the dish--->
        <Li> Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pan or pot over medium heat. Add ghee and let it melt. </Li>
        <Li> Once the ghee is hot, add the vermicelli and roast until it turns golden brown, stirring continuously to avoid burning. This should take about 3-5 minutes. Remove the vermicelli from the pan and set it aside.</Li>
        <Li>  In the same pan, add the chopped dates and nuts. Sauté them for a few minutes until they are slightly golden. Remove them from the pan and set aside.</Li>
        <Li> In the same pan, pour the milk and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.</Li>
        <Li> Add the roasted vermicelli to the milk and cook for another 5-7 minutes, or until the vermicelli is soft and cooked through.</Li>
        <Li> Add sugar and cardamom powder to the milk mixture. Stir well to combine and let it simmer for another 2-3 minutes.</Li>
        <Li> Finally, add the sautéed dates and nuts to the sheer khurma. Stir well and cook for another minute.</Li>
        <Li> Serve the sheer khurma warm or chilled, garnished with nuts if desired.Enjoy</Li>
